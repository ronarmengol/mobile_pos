## Why These Prices?

1.  **Affordability**: K200 is roughly the price of a few meals. For a business, this is a negligible expense if it saves them money on theft and errors.
2.  **Psychological Pricing**: Keeping the entry price under K300 makes it an "impulse buy" for a business owner.
3.  **Competition**: Local POS systems often charge high upfront fees (K5,000+ for hardware). A low monthly fee with "Bring Your Own Device" (use their own phone/laptop) is a huge competitive advantage.

## Key Selling Points for Zambia

1.  **"Bring Your Own Device"**: Works on any smartphone, tablet, or laptop. No need to buy expensive POS machines.
2.  **Offline-First**: Crucial for areas with unstable internet. (Note: We need to fully implement the PWA features discussed earlier to claim this).
3.  **Theft Prevention**: "Know exactly how much stock you have and how much cash should be in the drawer." This is your #1 selling point.
4.  **Local Support**: Being a Zambian developer offering local support is a massive trust factor compared to international software.

## Implementation Strategy

1.  **Free Trial**: Offer a 14-day free trial. No credit card required. Let them get addicted to the ease of use.
2.  **Setup Fee (Optional)**: You could charge a one-time **K500 setup fee** to go to their shop, upload their menu, and train their staff. This covers your transport and time.
3.  **Mobile Money Integration**: Ensure you can accept subscription payments via Airtel Money / MTN Mobile Money automatically.

## Next Steps

1.  **Polish the App**: Implement the "Premium" features (charts, offline mode) to justify the price.
2.  **Pilot Program**: Give the app to 3-5 shops for **free** for 1 month in exchange for feedback and testimonials.
3.  **Marketing**: Walk into shops with a tablet and show them the "Live Dashboard". Seeing their sales update in real-time is the best sales pitch.
